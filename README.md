# Oink Chat 🐽

# Tech

We opted for
- .NET Core 3

# Instructions

> **Prof said :**
> 
> In this project, you are asked to create a network based  multithreaded client-server chat app.
> 
> Chatters establish a connection with the server and can do the following :
> 1. Create a profile (login, password) and save it
> 1. Login
> 1. List topics
> 1. Create topics
> 1. Join topics (only one - bonus : many at the same time)
> 1. Send messages to all chatters on a specific topic
> 1. Send private messages 
> 
> You are free to add new functions to your app, but don't do that unless you've already implemented the ones given above. A graphical interface can be added to your app but this has to be the last phase in your project.
> 
> You should start this project by doing a full object oriented design of your desired app. This has to be documented in your report and presented to your supervisor (use UML diagrams for that purpose; use-case, sequence, state-transition, class diagrams).
